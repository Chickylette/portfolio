        <h2>Junkenstein's Revenge</h2>
        <p>
            Junkenstein's Revenge is a classic 4 player co-op event only available during Halloween in Overwatch. 
            The objective is to prevent the gate being destroyed by waves of enemies and bosses through playing as certain heroes.
            The gamemode has two different modes, a story mode and an endless mode.

        <h2>Endless Madness</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Endless Madness</strong> is a custom gamemode built on Overwatch's Endless mode, set to Legendary difficulty. All heroes will be playable in this gamemode. 
            Players will face a total of <strong>12 normal waves</strong> followed by <strong>16 bonus waves</strong>. 
            The mode introduces several new mechanics to enrich the experience, including a <strong>money and shop system</strong>, 
            customizable <strong>hero stats</strong>, <strong>special wave events</strong>, and the powerful <strong>Super Ultimate</strong> abilities.
        </p>

        <section id="creative-process">
            <h2>Creative Process</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Endless Madness</strong> began in 2020, shortly after Junkenstein's Revenge became available in the Overwatch Workshop. 
              While some gameplay elements were inspired by other Workshop modes, the core idea was to design a fun, replayable experience that me and my friends could enjoy together during Halloween.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a casual side project quickly evolved into a yearly tradition. 
              As I continued to develop and refine the gamemode, I added new mechanics, adjusted the balance, and introduced original features to make the experience more engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the launch of Overwatch 2 and the arrival of new heroes, I introduced the <strong>Super Ultimate</strong> system in 2023, expanding the strategic depth of the gamemode. 
              Additional ultimates and enhancements followed in 2024, building on player feedback and creative experimentation.

            <h3>Money System Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Inspired by a community game, this core feature of Endless Madness is the use of <strong>money</strong> as a gameplay resource. Players earn money throughout 
                the match and can spend it to <strong>upgrade their hero's stats</strong>, <strong>purchase game-changing abilities</strong>, 
                and unlock unique <strong>Super Ultimate</strong> powers.
            </p>

            <h4>How to Earn Money</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <strong>Blue Circle (near the gate):</strong> Standing in this circle grants periodic income. This blue circle will occur at the front of the gate.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Passive Income Zones (Green Circles):</strong> Passive income is granted over time and can be increased by 
                standing inside green circles placed around the map. Two appear at the start of the game at the corners next to the gate, and a third green circle is 
                introduced after the normal wave phase ends, appearing in the middle of the map.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Blood Stone (Red Circle):</strong> A high-risk, high-reward mechanic. Players can stand in the red circle to 
                sacrifice their own health in exchange for a large sum of money. This area appears only after the normal waves are completed. It will appear at the hay next to the third green circle.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Boss Kills:</strong> Defeating bosses also grants bonus money, encouraging players to focus fire and complete 
                waves efficiently.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>How to Spend Money (Shop)</h4>
            <p>
                Players can access the in-game <strong>shop</strong> to enhance their performance and customize their playstyle. Available upgrades include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health</strong> – Increases your overall survivability.</li>
                <li><strong>Healing per second</strong> – Boosts health regeneration over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Healing received/dealt</strong> – Enhances incoming and outgoing healing effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Damage received/dealt</strong> – Adjusts damage intake and output for better combat performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Projectile speed</strong> – Improves hit accuracy and reaction time.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement speed</strong> – Increases mobility for dodging or repositioning.</li>
                <li><strong>Objective multiplier</strong> – Amplifies income generation from standing in circles around the map.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The shop also unlocks powerful <strong>abilities</strong> as the game progresses, including unique options like 
                <em>Lifesteal, Flying, and Super Ultimate</em> abilities. These additions allow for deep strategic builds and 
                player-specific customizations.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Waves and Bosses</h3>
            <p>
                Endless Madness maintains the core wave structure of the original mode but introduces dynamically scaling bosses. 
                All non-boss enemies function as they do in the base game, ensuring familiar mechanics. However, 
                <strong>boss enemies are scaled based on the current wave</strong>, increasing in difficulty, health, and damage output 
                as the game progresses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Defeating a boss rewards players with a <strong>bonus money payout</strong>, adding an extra incentive for precise 
                coordination and tactical plays. Each bonus wave also has the potential to introduce special boss modifiers or 
                combinations, keeping the gameplay unpredictable and exciting.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Super Ultimate</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Super Ultimate</strong> was created to enhance overall playgame dynamic and it is a powerful ultimate that strengthens the original. 
                Every Super Ultimate is uniquely designed and influenced by either the creator’s favorite <strong>anime</strong> and 
                <strong>video game</strong> inspirations, or Overwatch's lore and heroes' ultimate. From flashy multi-stage attacks to transformation sequences, these abilities 
                bring a layer of personal flair and creative storytelling to each hero, making their peak moments feel <em></em>truly memorable.
